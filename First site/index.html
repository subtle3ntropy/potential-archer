  <section class="introduction-section"><p>Greetings Netizens! Your average, nearly halfway to thirty years old chinese working class man here. When I got accepted into NYCDA, I didn't know what to expect from the course. What I did expect is the quitting of my kitchen staff job and taking out a bank loan to pay for classes :'( Atleast I feel mighty ambitious and my parents are letting me stay with them without charging rent.<br><br></p><img src="http://memecrunch.com/meme/18Y3W/so-i-got-that-goin-for-me/image.png">

<section class="location-section"><h>Where I'm from</h>
    <p1>I am recognized on legal documents as a Chinese American. My mother gave birth to me in NYC on December 3rd, 1990. Months after, my parents decided to drop me off with my grandparents in China.<br> At age five, three strangers; a man, a woman and a little girl visited my family in China to claim ownership of me and take me back with them to the states. To this day, I still do not know if these are my real parents. However I do love them and owe them an enormous debt in raising me. Putting them through retirement is the least I can do.</p1>

<section class="questions-section"><h3><br>More about me or something!</h3>
<h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
<p>I love to start MMORPGS and wake up four years later hating the game and lacking any sense of identity or the state of my life... Is what I would like to say if I were still as young and privilaged as my teenager self. But until then I like casual uncommited gaming, and drinking coffee with half and half; no sugar. <br>I attended hip hop classes on a whim as well and stuck with it for three years! I may still be an amateur, but I am a veteran in the eyes of a beginner :) I would call it a hobby but I haven't danced in over half a year. If I were ever to be financially stable and forced to confront civilization few times a week, I would revisit my dancer self :D</p></section><section class="Dreamjob">
    <h2><br>What's your dream job?</h2>
    <p>My dream job is to be in the top 1% of professional gamers and win tournaments. My games would be on live streaming, and make a living off subscribers and donations from my viewers. Back to dreaming it is!</p>
    </section><section class="music">
    <h2>What music do you listen to?</h2>
    <p>I've gone through many phases of music, and although I don't listen to early 2000s POP music anymore; if any Linkin Park or N'sync came on... THAT'S MY JAM! I recently came out of an Iron Maidan, Frank Sinatra, and K-pop phase. When I say phase, I mean if I find music that I enjoy listening to, you will find me churning the same playlist of a couple dozen songs for months without changing it. I've always been a fan of Nat King Cole, but for the past week his songs have been playing in my head over and over with missing lyrics here and there that annoyed me to no end. Welcome new playlist to my life!</p>

    <section class="years">
    <h2>Where do you see yourself in 10 years?</h2>
    <p>I can see myself being halfway to 40! However, if I work hard and have a bit of luck, maybe in a decade I would have a career. I would own property and have married my girlfriend of two years who deserves more than
the world that I can provide right this moment.I also see myself working long hours and paying taxes. The highlight of my week would be to get carded at the supermarket purchasing bottles of beer for $1.50 each. Then head home to drink where pants aren't necessary. </section>
